- 👋 Hi, I’m Hiro(shi)!
- 👀 I’m interested in science, probabilty and other "modern" mathematics such as fractal geometry (tho I don't understand them that much).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to _really_ live.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will push the probability of human extending its life on the universe, primarily through medical techonologies and discoveries of new physical laws.
